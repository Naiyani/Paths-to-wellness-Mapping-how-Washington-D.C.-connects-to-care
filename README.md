# Paths-to-wellness-Mapping-how-Washington-D.C.-connects-to-care

### Problem Statement
- Access to healthcare is a vital component of urban well-being, yet not all neighbourhoods enjoy equal proximity to medical services. Washington, D.C. has a range of healthcare facilities - including hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies but their distribution may not align with population density or need.

### This project seeks to answer the question:
- "Which areas in Washington, D.C. have limited access to healthcare facilities within a reasonable distance, and how does this vary by population density across wards?"

### Dataset: (OpendataDC)
- DC health Faclities
- Population by census Tract
- Ward boundaries
- Road Network Data
