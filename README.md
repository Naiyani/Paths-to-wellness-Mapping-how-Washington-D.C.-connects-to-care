# Path to Wellness: Mapping Healthcare Accessibility in Washington, D.C.

## 📍 Overview
This project analyzes healthcare accessibility across Washington, D.C., with a primary focus on **hospital access**, which is critical during medical emergencies. Using spatial analysis and data visualization, the project identifies neighborhoods that may face challenges in reaching hospitals, even when other healthcare facilities such as pharmacies or primary care centers are available.

The project integrates **GIS-based static maps created in ArcGIS Pro** with an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to communicate spatial patterns and disparities in healthcare access across wards and census tracts.

## ❓ Problem Statement
In emergency situations, individuals rely on **nearby hospitals** for immediate care. However, hospital access is not evenly distributed across Washington, D.C. This project addresses the issue of **unequal hospital accessibility** by identifying areas with longer travel distances and limited hospital coverage, which may negatively impact emergency response and health outcomes.

## 🗂️ Data Sources
- Washington, D.C. healthcare facility data (hospitals, pharmacies, primary care centers)
- Census tract–level population data
- Ward boundary shapefiles

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
- ArcGIS Pro (spatial analysis, network-based distance calculation, static mapping)
- Power BI (interactive dashboard development)
- Spatial data cleaning and preprocessing
- Choropleth and proportional symbol mapping
- Census tract–level spatial analysis
- Data storytelling and visualization design

## 📊 Analysis Summary
The analysis reveals noticeable variation in healthcare accessibility across Washington, D.C. Certain high-population wards experience **longer distances to hospitals**, highlighting potential challenges during emergencies. While pharmacies and primary care centers are more evenly distributed, **hospital access remains uneven** in several neighborhoods.

Low-access areas identified in the analysis indicate locations where healthcare services may not adequately meet population needs, particularly during time-sensitive medical situations.
